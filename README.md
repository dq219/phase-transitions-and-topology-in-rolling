# Phase transisions and topology in rolling

This code repository contains details of constructing irregular 2D and 3D bodies using Fourier modes, and simulation scripts for their rolling motion under gravity on an inclined ramp. Non-slip constraints are assumed, and rotational viscosity and moment of inertia are isotropic for simplicity. Main results include:

- 2D rolling results
	- First-order halting-cruising transition in viscous 2D rolling
	- Second-order halting-cruising transition in inertia 2D rolling
	- Hysteresis in inertia 2D rolling, with a first-order cruising-halting transition

- 3D rolling results
	- Second-order halting-cruising transition in viscous 3D rolling
	- Periodicity in viscous 3D rolling
	- Period-doubling in inertia 3D rolling
